This repository was implemented as an exercise for Intive-FDV, following the guidelines in this gist:

# Context
A company rents bikes under following options:

1. Rental by hour, charging $5 per hour
2. Rental by day, charging $20 a day
3. Rental by week, changing $60 a week
4. Family Rental, is a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total price

# Assigment:
1. Implement a set of classes to model this domain and logic
2. Add automated tests to ensure a coverage over 85%
3. Use GitHub to store and version your code
4. Apply all the recommended practices you would use in a real project
5. Add a README.md file to the root of your repository to explain: your design, the development practices you applied and how run the tests.

Note: we don't expect any kind of application, just a set of classes with its automated tests.

# Deliverables:
The link to your repository
